# `printf("Hello World!");`
I'm Addy Luo, a college student who is interested in computer science.

Here stores some LeetCode problems I consider helpful for my learning. They are sorted by their solving method.

(Since there might be several solutions for one problem, I'll leave the link of each method.)

I currently use C and C# to write code, and I'll try to give solutions in both languages.

Still a newbie in this area, so my code might be not that clean. It will be of great help if you leave some comments :)
